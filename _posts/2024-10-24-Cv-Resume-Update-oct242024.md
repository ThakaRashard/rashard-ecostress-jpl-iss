## resume Period Review
I got super lax and personal after i realized i was being recognized outdoors so i let ppl get an iframe of a couple of video games. Alot of Jehovahs Witnesses were scared of me when they saw my entertainment but [Darkstalkers](https://darkstalkers.fandom.com/wiki/Darkstalkers_(series)) is just [Grimms FairyTales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms%27_Fairy_Tales) and ppl say "Thats Demonized" and run inn terror, or buy your wife in sex slavery, it all just depends on how close they are to [Jehovah](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/draw-close/). And over Covid Lockdown Normani had me making a lot of social accounts so she could track me breathing, i get more now about online relationships and finding a balance on how to post her freidns when according to my documentation she is my slated primary an gonna help me get access to my kid. They in the Porno World its being victimized, bc thats what happens when geirls vanish, its just life. [A lot of black men get dissabled in school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qgw0r29GYw) so A lot of my peers if they had no military affiliation they were sitting ducks when the Bosshogs boys wanted sex from our girlfriends but since NAsa picked me up for [The Mission To Mars](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/topics/mars/) as a [Unix Administrator](https://unix.org/) [Level 5](https://www.opengroup.org/membership/forums/platform/unix) with Mechanical Opportunities in [Robotics](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-science-laboratory-curiosity-rover-msl/) ... The webdesigns were like Valentines Day cards the Matriarchy at Dance411/MAgicCity was supporting so the girls who wanted to live together after the collapse of the discord child prostitution mob dissolves they can pick a single man to live with. A lot of pods of girls from striptease were scouring Atlanta and i got picked by a handful. I make reports to the Military Air,Earth, and Space and correct identity fraud that often results from the sex trafficking they were forced into [rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_rape) So im sensitive about some of the design work bc i had crushes on a lot of girls at dance411 an they had another secret life surrounding MAgic City. The Black American population was being dissolved in Atlantas inner city and ppl were forced into homelessness and basically that means chased by Private Security while u try to reestablish yourself after one of your significant other's tunrs on you from Playboy fruad and abuse. I got framed for Rape, Murder, ChildMolestation and Kidnapping an the ppl talking to me! An one committed companioon died and performs live in [Hollywood at times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAmd1DQaotk0) an the Kid wears fishnet stockings! So i got all the BLackSuperDadShit out bc im working now, i dont have a desk for trinkets of them. Extractions can be read below. [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ricoThaka) and [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/396000267) iframes are so toxic! Man idk what ppl do with .js on my pages blog with those windows

# Current Status winter24jan30ish - old
While coronavirus quarantine shut down Georgia's government a sex party started among millenials. There was a populaton within the cult known as Jehovahs witnesses that wated to leave thier spouses they committed to in the org. I am a father of one child i know for sure! And her mother wanted in on the sex party and abandoned me leaving me with the child. She is now 10years old and has been spotted in #SouthernCalifornia her name is coral. The Sexparty people systematically fiscally diabled me and i eventually lost my daughter, i dont know where she is. A artist from my old world in georgia "Glorilla" twitter feed showed her holding two guns, a pistl and an assault rifle. While i am in need im mostly sufering from exclusion because i lost my family. There were a couple women who tried to step in but they work for playboy magazine and got publically humiliated for wanting to start a family with an abandoned man. I have no income. I have been robbed #ransomware i am not mentally disabled. I can do pickup work for cash or join a team for a misson that is complimentary to the United States Space Program. I am on the Mars Mission. A unix administrator. If your family is kidnapped and there are no acces to communications resorces Social Engineering makes it nearly impossible to communictae to meet ones needs. There are rumors of sexual scandal at some of my prior employers that effect my ability to interact with the world to get my needs met. I was diagenosed with Bipolar and Schizophrenia but no one will talk to me abt how my wife's lover used radio for electronic harasment and she was two timing me with a lethal criminal in our area! I am innocent, honest and hardworking I have no way to contact people except through real life meetups coordinated by NasaJPL in Pasadena #Seeking_Paid_Employment
