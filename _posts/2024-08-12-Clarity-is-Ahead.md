[Klax (set 1)](https://archive.org/details/arcade_klax) Klax is a puzzle video game released in arcades in 1990 by Atari Games while Namco distributed the game in Japanese markets. It was designed and animated by Mark Stephen Pierce with the software engineering done by Dave Akers. The object is to catch colored blocks tumbling down a machine and arrange them in colored rows and patterns to make them disappear. Klax was originally published as a coin-op follow-up to Tetris, about which Atari Games was in a legal dispute at the time. [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klax_(video_game)) [Klax](https://www.arcade-museum.com/Videogame/klax) Player must catch colored blocks rolling down a conveyer belt and stack them by color in vertical columns or, in higher levels, horizontal and diagonal rows. Higher levels also use more colors of blocks. A female voice announces each wave and offers praise for bonus points.[arcade museum](https://www.arcade-museum.com/Videogame/klax) [Sega genesis](https://www.retrogames.cc/genesis-games/klax-usa.html)

>NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance mission captured thrilling footage of its rover landing in Mars' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. The real footage in this video was captured by several cameras that are part of the rover's entry, descent, and landing suite. The views include a camera looking down from the spacecraft's descent stage (a kind of rocket-powered jet pack that helps fly the rover to its landing site), a camera on the rover looking up at the descent stage, a camera on the top of the aeroshell (a capsule protecting the rover) looking up at that parachute, and a camera on the bottom of the rover looking down at the Martian surface.

In this clip, Don "Magic" Juan talked about why prostitution will always be around and the reasons he believes a prostitute needs a pimp. He also spoke on his transition from pimping into a spiritual advisory role and how he uses his social media as a way to provide that for his followers. Bishop Don "Magic" Juan closed out by talking about maintaining his health, smoking weed since 12, and how he stayed away from all the other drugs. - [VLAD](https://www.youtube.com/@vladtv)
