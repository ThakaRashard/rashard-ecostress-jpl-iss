Please see the riot data I left for Mayor_Karen I also sent her an attachment about SEDAC I sent her data from HBASE b4 but I am learning her way a little, she is big-time telecom and I'm intimidated, she interviewed me for a web designer in 2002, I was not chosen and I still feel her critiques!

GM Ms_Petro! Its Rashard, I was trying to work on earthdata from sedac and my registration was blocked from lapl. I wrote Dave Gallager a note and I hope he can meet with Ms Bass about it..https://trello.com/c/k8bMJNy4/118-dave-gallagher-named-11th-director-of-jpl

There is a url thakasartu.github.io that's my significant others name that she gave me. I'm so confussed, I think its manessa for sure now

https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/lametro/jobs/4958723/information-technology-architectpayroll?keywords=&page=2&pagetype=jobOpportunitiesJobs  its too big for me, but i think the resistance a part of Lacounty has to the federal government from reading bad news over corrupt dns is what is primarily dividing us from intergrating them so we can all have clean benefits and regular pay. . . -#rashard

Good afternoon, the church was closed today, so I went to one on skid row. HEre is an archive with my active learning topics https://archive.org/details/mariner9_tv_companionbook-12  there's also earthdatawork, I'm being maliciously sabotaged on GitHub ATM idk if you are getting pure messages from me - rashard https://github.com/sessions/verified-device is a night mare message at the library! I also had an unpleasant run-in with GSG_PROTECTiVE I'm running out of time, so any EarthDataDutiers will be on paper, LAPL is closed tomorrow and  #LongBeach_City_Library  if its ok for me to come to the lab I may ride up there just to check in…. -rashard thakarashard.github.io as well /binder /rashardmro ricothakarashard.github.io
